# Characteristics of Components

- __Reusability__ − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- __Replaceable__ − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- __Not context specific__ − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- __Extensible__ − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- __Encapsulated__ − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- __Independent__ − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## Advantages

1. __Ease of deployment__ − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

2. __Reduced cost__ − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

3. __Ease of development__ − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

4. __Reusable__ − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

6. __Modification of technical complexity__ − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

7. __Reliability__ − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

8. __System maintenance and evolution__ − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

9. __Independent__ − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.
