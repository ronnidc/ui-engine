### Notes
- *(Removed empty directories: `/store`, `/plugins`, `/middleware`. Add later if needed)*

- Perhaps add a `.env` file to the root with `BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` (don't add it to GIT)

- Some directories in are hidden in the file explorer by `"files.exclude":` in vscode's workspace `settings.json`
